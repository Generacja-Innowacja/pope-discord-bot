## Description

Every day, at 9.37pm CET (Polish time), members can say "2137" in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1334532846077087816/1430641405243559947" target="_blank">#2137</a> to recieve a kremówka from the Pope himself!

It makes the atmosphere more competitive, but also more friendly at the same time, as well as keeping the server active.
